#Tabs

The Tabs extension creates an easy way to add interactive tabs layout to your wiki. It is designed to make things as easy as possible. There are currently two features in this extension: The "togglebox" and the "tabbox". See the Tabs.documentation.txt file for examples you can use to test this extension with. Simply paste the .txt file's contents onto a wiki page with the extension installed to test.
